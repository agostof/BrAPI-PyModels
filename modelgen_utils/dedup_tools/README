Step 1. copy contents of this folder to the same level as the api folder
Step 2. Call ./denumerate_dir.sh api  to renumber all numbered classes' numbers, as these classes are the same contents, just with different names.
Step 3. Clean up any remaining numbered classes (Denumerate.java lists a couple names where there are multiple different entities with the same 'name' and different numbers)
Step 4. Run remove_class_instances to remove all but one copy of duplicated class names. Note: Preserved copy is in alphabecical order. We want 'core' to have the residual if core has both.
This allows importing core to get all the entities that may or may not continue to exist in each model file.

Optional: Each file is now model.py in the folder of its type, you can spruce it up by renaming them to <foldername>.py and flattening the structure
